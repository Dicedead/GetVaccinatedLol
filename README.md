## Introduction: Why this document?
 
Eyyo! 

An interesting but alarming phenomenon happening specifically during this pandemic is people refusing to get vaccinated despite not being anti-vax nor believing that COVID-19 is a conspiracy. 

This document is for their friends who are trying to reason with them: use this text as a tool as it contains detailed sources and some common arguments in favor of getting vaccinated, as well as some common arguments in favor of not getting vaccinated - and why they fall short. Indeed, we find ourselves looking for that one source or reference quite often during a discussion, and this text is meant to help you help your vaccine reluctant friend.
